 <li>Let <em>A </em>be a 4×4 matrix, use elementary row operation matrices to find one matrix <em>E </em>such that <em>EA</em>=<em>B</em>, where B is obtained from A using the following three row operations in a row (watch for the order): multiply row 2 by -3, interchange row 1 and row 4 of the obtained matrix and then add 2 times row 2 to the third row of the newly obtained matrix. What is the inverse of this matrix <em>E</em>?</li>

 <li>Check whether each of the following matrices is in reduced row echelon form or non-reduced row echelon form. Briefly justify your results.</li>
